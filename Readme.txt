Hi there, I'm using python 3.7.3 to run these programs.
To run my programs, you need the following packets:

sklearn    version:0.23.2
tensorflow 2.5.0
pandas 1.2.4
numpy 1.19.4
matplotlib 3.3.2

The way to run the program: 
Open the progrom using software like vscode, click on the run button, then it shall be fine.

The nn_network.py is using neural network
And the KNeighborsClassifier.py is using KNN
Files in the folder: recent_files are original data transformed from the wireshark
generate_data.py use the csv files in recent_files to generate the data_set.csv and make a simple
plot on the RSS data.

nn_network.py and KNeighborsClassifier.py use data_set.py to do the trainning and testing.s
